# A Letter for You ❤️ | Classical UI Experiment

A bespoke, interactive digital letter crafted with a "Classical" aesthetic. This project explores the intersection of traditional typography and modern web technologies, featuring a parchment-style interface, procedural animations, and a focus on user experience.



## ✨ Features

* **Classical UI:** A custom-built parchment container using pure CSS (no external image assets for borders) featuring a "Gold Inlay" strap and burnt edges.
* **Procedural Heart Animation:** An HTML5 Canvas-based particle system generating mathematically accurate Bézier curve hearts.
* **Typewriter Reveal:** A sequential typewriter effect that guides the reader through the message at a romantic, steady pace.
* **Bespoke Letterhead:** A custom "Wax Seal" inspired header featuring my nickname (Niku).
* **Responsive Design:** Fully optimized for mobile devices using Tailwind CSS, ensuring the "Letter" fits perfectly on any screen.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** HTML5, Tailwind CSS
* **Logic:** Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Graphics:** HTML5 Canvas API (2D Context)
* **Typography:** Google Fonts (Great Vibes & Playfair Display)
